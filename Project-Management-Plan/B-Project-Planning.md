## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle

The project management life cycle creates a guidelines for VESOONIS staff to follow so that they can achieve the milestones from time to time. It is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart. Every member of the team such as project manager's task and work are breakdown into several modules through the project life cycle WBS. Each member of the VESOONIS have their own roles and part in every stage of the life cycle according to the constructed WBS. 

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

As for the Fake News Detection Project, the system WBS are represented as follow. This WBS is constructed to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as interface design, API management, and Fake News Detection:

### Scope

A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process in which the WBS will be approved and maintained throughout the project.

In this fake news detection project, we need to identify the scope of the project. For instance, the project will not accept documents or text that violates the requirement provided by the system to avoid error. For example, the text or documents are not written in English will not be acceptable. Besides, this project scope down the limit of the project by only detecting and recognizing English alphabet and number character. Therefore, country that do not use English as first language might not be able to use this system.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Substandard design, materials, and workmanship: The design of the API makes it harder for user to use <br> (How to submit text or file and what type of file can be submitted) |How: Feedback from tester <br><br> When: The problem of interface design will be determined during the unit testing phase| Have one member to keep track of the feedback from testers for continuous update of interface design|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)| 1. Contingency: The server's cost will rise if one of the developers fails to shut down the EC2 instance while not in use.. | How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.| Notify the owner through email or discord whenever budget exceed threshold in the AWS cloud computing service. |
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are not enough server to be used to run the fake news detection model training  |How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Ask support from the other team member and switch their task or job to other job to avoid him/her to stuck in the problem loop.|

In a fake news detection project, for example, the team must extract relevant words from numerous texts and documents. This session could be problematic if the team is obliged to violate the privacy of a consumer. As a result, this issue will be listed and solutions will be explored within the team. <br><br> Every stage of this project may encounter unanticipated difficulties. As a result, the risk management must record each and every risk so that they can avoid and take precautions to ensure that the problem does not occur.
| Administrative Manager | Beh Kar Soon | The Administrative Manager leads the cost management effort, which includes sponsoring cost budgeting and monitoring activities, encouraging communication on fiscal status, and ensuring the project cost tool and accompanying paperwork are maintained.

| Project Scheduler | Beh Kar Soon | The Project Scheduler's responsibility is to coordinate and manage plan inputs such as tracking progress against the project schedule, merging and detecting dependencies and hazards between the project schedule, and tracking progress on the prime contractor's and counties' schedules. Next, the primary function of a financial analyst is to sift through data to uncover opportunities and analyse the consequences of this false news identification. <br><br>In brief, the Project Scheduler's job is to design the progress flow and track it in order to keep the system's development progress under control and to avoid unforeseen risk created by delays or interruptions in progress. |
| Quality Manager | Haziq | The Quality Manager is in charge of managing and ensuring the false news detection system, as well as the Prime Contractor's quality. By reviewing process and product activities for conformity to standards and plans, the Quality Manager provides insight into the project and contractor methods of doing business. <br><br>The quality manager is highly crucial in our project because he must analyse all of the system's quality and evaluate the final output so that the system can accurately detect the automobile plate without making ridiculous mistakes. Finally, the quality manager will report to top management, such as the project manager, on the quality standard issues so that the project can be improved.|
| Stakeholder Coordinator | Veenida | To facilitate the effective deployment and continuous maintenance of the Fake News Detection system, the Stakeholder Coordinator serves as the primary link between stakeholders and the Project Office. <br><br>The Coordinator addresses stakeholder-related issues and guarantees timely resolution, in addition to monitoring crucial continuing stakeholder interactions. Stakeholder issues are managed by the Coordinator by establishing and managing the section of the Issue and Escalation Process that impacts the stakeholders.
