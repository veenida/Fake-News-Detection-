# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle

The project management life cycle creates a guidelines for VESOONIS staff to follow so that they can achieve the milestones from time to time. It is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart. Every member of the team such as project manager's task and work are breakdown into several modules through the project life cycle WBS. Each member of the VESOONIS have their own roles and part in every stage of the life cycle according to the constructed WBS. 

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

As for the Fake News Detection Project, the system WBS are represented as follow. This WBS is constructed to breakdown the technical part of the project into several modules such as interface design, API management, and Fake News Detection:

### Scope

A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process in which the WBS will be approved and maintained throughout the project.

In this fake news detection project, we need to identify the scope of the project. For instance, the project will not accept documents or text that violates the requirement provided by the system to avoid error. For example, the text or documents are not written in English will not be acceptable. Besides, this project scope down the limit of the project by only detecting and recognizing English alphabet and number character. Therefore, country that do not use English as first language might not be able to use this system.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Substandard design, materials, and workmanship: The design of the API makes it harder for user to use <br> (How to submit text or file and what type of file can be submitted) |How: Feedback from tester <br><br> When: The problem of interface design will be determined during the unit testing phase| Have one member to keep track of the feedback from testers for continuous update of interface design|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)| 1. Contingency: The costing of the server will be spike if one of the developer forget to shutdown the EC2 instance when not using it. | How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.| Notify the owner through email or discord whenever budget exceed threshold in the AWS cloud computing service. |
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are not enough server to be used to run the fake news detection model training  |How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Ask support from the other team member and switch their task or job to other job to avoid him/her to stuck in the problem loop.|
