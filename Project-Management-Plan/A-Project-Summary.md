## Project Summary :

In this modernized era lead by science and technology, the spread of information evolves with the advancement of technology. If before this, we need to read newspaper and watch the news on television, we now can access all of it with a single touch on smart devices. From news to reports, everything are now shared online on the internet and can be access by anyone at anytime. However, this results in an issue that gathers the attention of researchers and scientist. It is how to sort out the fake news and the genuine news. The spread of false information can caused a lot of bad things to happen. Even with good encryption and filter on what information can be passed on the internet, there will still be some that escape and be accessed by everyone. This may caused clash in the unity of people around the world if the 
wrong information involves cultural mockery.

Therefore, researchers have been working on a way to solve the issue. With a lot of study and researches, they come up with an idea to integrate natural language processing (NLP) in detecting fake news automatically and thus, can filter out the hoax in more efficient ways than the traditional method. The NLP model will use supervised machine learning method and neural network to learn how to classify genuine and fake news. In our project, the user need to insert the news title, the content of the news and the system will automaticaly generate the result which is fake or real news.


## Problem Statement :<br>

In this day and age, it is extremely difficult to decide whether the news we come across is real or not. There are very few options to check the authenticity and all of them are sophisticated and not accessible to the average person. There is an acute need for a web-based fact-checking platform that harnesses the power of Machine Learning to provide us with that opportunity.

## Objectives :

* To implement multiple model to identify fake news using text documents<br>
* To develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect fake news and genuine news.<br>
* To solve the issue of fake news spreading on the internet<br>

## Project Significance :<br>

This project will examine the performance of various models in the process of classifying fake news from text document using multiple machine learning models 
and performance measures.

## Conclusion :<br>

In conclusion, this project will use a Machine Learning model to classify fake news using text document of fake news and real news. We will compare and choose 
the best appropriate model for classifying the detection of fake news when we have completed all of the models.
