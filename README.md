# Fake-News-Detection

The definition of fake news is to include content that misdirects readers. Nowadays fake news spreading like water and people share this information without verifying it. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. So, our group decided build a project that detect fake news directly based on the text content of news articles with using Artificial Intelligence technique such as Machine learning and Deep Learning. 

To better structure the project's lifecycle, the project is produced using a Project Management Plan (PMP). To manage the project, several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) are employed.
