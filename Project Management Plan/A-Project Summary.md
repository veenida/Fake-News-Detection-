**Project Summary :**

**Problem Statement :**<br>
In this day and age, it is extremely difficult to decide whether the news we come across is real or not. There are very few options to check the authenticity and all of them are sophisticated and not accessible to the average person. There is an acute need for a web-based fact-checking platform that harnesses the power of Machine Learning to provide us with that opportunity.

**Objectives :**

* To implement multiple model to identify fake news using text documents<br>
* To develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect fake news and genuine news.<br>
* To solve the issue of fake news spreading on the internet<br>

**Project Significance :**<br>
This project will examine the performance of various models in the process of classifying fake news from text document using multiple machine learning models 
and performance measures.

**Conclusion ;**<br>
In conclusion, this project will use a Machine Learning model to classify fake news using text document of fake news and real news. We will compare and choose 
the best appropriate model for classifying the detection of fake news when we have completed all of the models.
