**Project Summary**

**Problem Statement**
In this day and age, it is extremely difficult to decide whether the news we come
across is real or not. There are very few options to check the authenticity and all of
them are sophisticated and not accessible to the average person. There is an acute
need for a web-based fact-checking platform that harnesses the power of Machine
Learning to provide us with that opportunity.

**Objectives:**

* To develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect Malaysia car number plate<br>
* To develop a system that are able to recognize the character of the car number plate<br>
* To develop an application programming interface (API) for the future ease of use as the integration module<br>
